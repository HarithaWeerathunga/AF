    ● Create a function named taxCalculator which accepts
    the tax percentage as an
    argument.

        taxCalculator should return another function
        which accepts the amount as an argument
    and returns calculated tax percentage
    (amount*taxPercentage/100).
● Call taxCalculator function and assigned
the returned value to a variable.
● Now, call that variable (it is a function now)
with different amounts and get tax value
    calculated.
● Notice how you have encapsulated the tax
 percentage and calculation from consumers.
        Now consumers can calculate the tax
        percentage without the knowledge of tax
    percentage and calculation.
