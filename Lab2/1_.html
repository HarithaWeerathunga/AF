● Declare a variable named vehicleName in the window object (var) and assign value
‘Toyota’ to it. This a global variable declaration.
● Declare a function named printVehicleNameOuter to print out the vehicle name. (Use
this.vehicleName, since the variable you declared in the above step is a global variable
assigned to window object. In global scope this points to window object. In the browser
scope global object is window object and all the global variable and function
declarations are assigned to window object).
○ Test this by printing this and window object to console. And verify that they
both prints window object.
○ Check the vehicleName and the printVehicleNameOuter you declared are in the
printed window object.
● Call the function printVehicleNameOuter and verify it is printing ‘Toyota’.
● Declare an object named Vehicle (using object literal notation ‘{}’) which have a variable
called vehicleName and assigned the value ‘Nissan’ to it. Declare a function named
printVehicleNameInner and assign printVehicleNameOuter to it.
● Execute the printVehicleNameInner function and see the results.
